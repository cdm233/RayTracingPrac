# RayTracingPrac
This is a ray tracer program that I, Derek Chen, wrote. This program was rewritten in 2022 after I finished my first major project Unimap.

# Initial Release
This is the initial release and some features it had.
## Anti aliasing
This is the image rendered at 1080P of two sphere with 0 anti aliasing.

This is the image rendered at 1080P of two sphere with 100 ray anti-aliasing.

The anti aliasing is done by emitting multiple dispersed rays into different directions from the same origin and then summing them up. The performance liability was moderate: runtime 52s

# Update 1
This update added multi-threading support to renderer, restrctured code, and changed the image output logic. Now the previous render, which had a run time of 52 seconds, is now 5.42 seconds.

# Update 2
This updates adds PNG exporting support, it also includes the command to compile the program in a .txt file.
The command is:
gcc -O3 main.cpp ./src/*.cpp -I ./src/ -fopenmp -lstdc++ -o main.exe
